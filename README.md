- I chose a HashMap as my data structure because it provides a fast lookup for events by just using the date. It is a hashmap that has the date as a key and the value is another hashmap that has the times as the key and the event as values. I did this because if the hashmap contains more than 1 value then there may be a chance of overlap. Although I did not complete my algorithm, I initally wanted to go through the hashmap to see if there were more than 2 times for a date and if there was then I would check if the times overlapped or not. I ended up finidng online that there was a Date for java where I can easily check if the dates and time overlapped, however I was not able to get to it.
